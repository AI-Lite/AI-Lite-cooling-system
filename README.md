# AI-Lite-cooling-system  

---

### Overview
Since AI-Lite has been commercialized, only the prototype code has been made open source. Additionally, we also provide a portion of real experimental data from physical clusters.
#### Simulator
```python
virtual_env_generator_v1.py
virtual_env_generator_v1_2.py
virtual_env_simulation.py
virtual_env_simulation_2.py
```
We use the above file to simulate the data center environment.
#### AI-Lite Model and Baseline Schenems
```python
gaussian_bandit.py
```
The file above is our core file, that implement AI-Lite. The rest of other files is baseline schemes.
#### Data
The folder, whose name is data, include experimental data from physial clusters.
